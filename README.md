# PureNumbers

You are given a special set of pure numbers.

A pure number has the following properties:

It comprises only 4 and 5.
It is a palindrome number.
The number of digits in a pure number is even.
For example, 4444,5445,44 are the pure numbers while 12,444,4545 are not. You are given a list of pure numbers in an ascending order. So, purenumber[1] < purenumber[2].

The first few elements in the list are as follows: 44,55,4444,....

You will be given an integer and you have to find pure number from the list.

Explanation
Here, T=3 that means there are 3 test cases
In the 1st test case N=1, so we have to print the 1st pure number that is 44
Similarly, in 2nd and 3rd Test cases, we have to print the 2nd and 3rd pure number in the series. Hence, we have to print 55 and 4444 respectively.
